# Title 
No-Show Appointments: Analysis & Prediction
# Description
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting medical appointment no-shows using Python. No-shows can lead to inefficiencies in healthcare, increased costs, and longer wait times for patients. The goal of this project is to identify key factors influencing patient attendance and develop a data-driven approach to minimize missed appointments.

By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project aims to:
✔️ Identify patterns and trends in no-show appointments
✔️ Understand the impact of factors like age, gender, medical history, and SMS reminders
✔️ Develop predictive models to estimate the likelihood of a patient missing an appointment

This analysis can help healthcare providers optimize scheduling, improve patient engagement, and reduce appointment no-shows, leading to better resource management and patient care.
